Purpose

By responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP), the Proposer agrees that s/he has read and understood all documents within this RFP package.

Submission Details

Responders to this RFP should supply:

<ul>
<li>A business report up to 4 pages (not including cover page, table of contents, or any needed
appendix), including any supporting plots and tables.
</li>
<li>The commented code used to produce the results.
The report should address all points described in the ‚ÄúObjective‚Äù section below. The report should be returned in the following way:
</li>
</ul>
‚Ä¢ Electronic (submit via Moodle)

Background

The Commercial Banking Corporation (hereafter the ‚ÄúBank‚Äù), acting by and through its department of Customer Services and New Products is seeking proposals for banking services. The Bank ultimately wants to predict which customers will buy a variable rate annuity product.

A variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company / bank, under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you, beginning either immediately or at some future date. You purchase a variable annuity contract by making either a single purchase payment or a series of purchase payments.

A variable annuity offers a range of investment options. The value of your investment as a variable annuity owner will vary depending on the performance of the investment options you choose. The investment options for a variable annuity are typically mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or some combination of the three. If you are interested in more information, see: http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/varannty.htm

The project will be broken down into 3 phases:

<ul>
<li>Phase 1 ‚Äì Variable Understanding and Assumptions</li>
<li>Phase 2 ‚Äì Variable Selection and Modeling Building</li>
<li>Phase 3 ‚Äì Model Assessment and Prediction
Objective ‚Äì Phase 1

The scope of services in this phase includes the following:
</li>
</ul>
‚Ä¢ For this phase use only the training data set.

‚Ä¢ Explore the predictor variables individually with the target variable of whether the customer bought the insurance product.

o Summarizeonlythesignificantvariablesinatablerankingfrommostsignificanttoleast significant ‚Äì the Bank currently uses ùõº = 0.002, but is open to another if you defend your reason.

¬ß This table should separate out the four possible classes of variables ‚Äì binary, ordinal, nominal, continuous.

<ul>
<li>¬ß &nbsp;(HINT: Explore the predictor variables individually for now since you have not yet accounted for missing values.)</li>
<li>¬ß &nbsp;(HINT: The downside to software sometimes is displaying a full p-value for ranking. That doesn‚Äôt mean you cannot get them through the right commands. As long as you have the same degrees of freedom you can rank on test statistic as well.)</li>
</ul>
o Inanappendix,includeatablewithallofthevariablesrankedbysignificance.

‚Ä¢ Provide a table of odds ratios for only binary predictor variables in relation to the target

variable.

o Ranktheseoddsratiosbymagnitude.

o Interpretonlythehighestmagnitudeoddsratio. o Reportonanyinterestingfindings.

¬ß (HINT: This is open-ended and has no correct answer. However, you should get use to keeping an eye out for what you might deem important or interesting when exploring data to report in an executive summary.)

‚Ä¢ Provide a summary of results around the linearity assumption of continuous variables.

o Listbothwhichvariablesmeetanddonotmeettheneededassumptionforcontinuous

variables.

o (HINT:Donotgetoverlymathematicalhere.Justreportwhatyoufind;donotteach.)

‚Ä¢ Provide a summary of important data considerations as follows:

o Visualrepresentationofwhichvariableshavethehighest(definedbyyoufornow)

amount of missing values.

o ListanycombinationsofvariablesthatyoufeelhaveredundantinformationsotheBank

might consider removing them in the future.

¬ß (HINT: This is open-ended and has no correct answer. For example, presence of

a money market account and money market balance.) o Reportonanyinterestingfindings.

¬ß (HINT: This is open-ended and has no correct answer. However, you should get use to keeping an eye out for what you might deem important or interesting when exploring data to report in an executive summary. For example, teller visits as well as other variables might represent human contact with the bank as compared to only online contact.)
